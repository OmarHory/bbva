     "collect_information": """Extract the following information from the user's query if available:
    - License Plate Number (Numbers, Letters, etc.)
    - Location (City, Country, etc.)
    - Access Code (Numbers, Words or combination of both)


    Guidelines:
    1. Determine which information is provided and which is missing.
    2. Users may provide all of the information or some of it.
    3. Sometimes, the user will provide information without labeling it as license plate or location, figure out which one is provided.


    ## License Plate Number Instructions:
        1. Extract **only** the vehicle license plate provided by the user.
        2. License plates are typically composed of 4 numbers followed by 3 letters (e.g., 1234ABC), with no spaces, punctuation marks, or extra words.
        3. The text may include errors or be transcribed with spoken words as letters ("S for Seville," "double V," "Greek i") or numbers as words ("four five six seven").
        4. Convert letter names or cities to their corresponding letter: We were unable to obtain the license plate from the information provided by the user.
        - "S de Sevilla" → S
        - "V" or "Double U" → W
        - "i griega" → Y
        - "ene" or "Navarra" → N
        - "ache" or "Huelva" → H
        - Etc.
        5. If the user provides separate numbers or letters, such as "45 67 Sevilla Málaga Sello", you must correctly reconstruct the license plate as "4567SMS".
        6. Remove any characters that are not letters or numbers.
        7. Do not return any additional text. **Only** the clean license plate (for example: `1234ABC`).
        8. If you cannot clearly identify a valid license plate, or it is not in a valid format, we will use the "Unrecognized Tractor Plate" output.
        9. If you can extract and identify a valid license plate, use the "Recognized Tractor Plate" output.

        ### Valid examples:

        - Input: "My license plate is one two three four A B C"
        License Plate: `1234ABC`

        - Input: "The license plate is four five six seven Seville Malaga Stamp"
        License Plate: `4567SMS`

        - Input: "It is 9876 double V Greek i Zeta"
        License Plate: `9876WYZ`

        - Input: "My car has the license plate 1234 Barcelona Barcelona Barcelona"
        License Plate: `1234BBB`

        - Input: "My license plate is 1234 comma dot A B C"
        License Plate: `1234ABC`

        ### Invalid examples (do not return anything):

        - Input: "I don't have the license plate now"
        - Input: "I'll send it to you later"
        - Input: "My car is red"

        ## Location Instructions:
        - Extract the location from the user's query.
        - The location is typically a city or country.
        - The location is usually provided in the user's query without being labeled as location.
        - This could be a city, warehouse, industrial area, street address, or any identifiable place.

        ## Access Code Instructions:
        extract only the keyword or access code from the user’s speech. It may follow phrases like:

        "My keyword is"

        "The code is"

        "My access password is"

        "The password is"

        "It is"

        The code can be a single word or multiple words (e.g., "teseo", "georgia", "josé miguel", "elena martín").

        The code could have a space in it.

        The code could be a city name or a country name, dont be confused with the location, so use the conversation history to figure out which one is the code.

        Remove quotes, punctuation, filler words, or symbols.

        Keep accents if mentioned (e.g., "josé miguel", not "jose miguel").

        Do not return any leading phrases like “The code is”, “It’s”, etc. Return only the clean access code.

        The user may also give the code directly without any leading phrase.
